# Spark-Streaming-Detection-Clusters-Of-Similar-Values-And-Outliers

Abstract
The negative consequences of non-revenue water losses from Water Distribution Systems (WDS) can be reduced through the successful and prompt identification of bursts and abnormal conditions. Here we present a preliminary investigation into the application of a probabilistic demand forecasting approach to identify pipe bursts. The method produces a probabilistic forecast of future demand under normal conditions. This, in turn, quantifies the probability that a future observation is abnormal.

Local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were first introduced for cluster and outlier detection in geographical studies.

They are based on observations of the same property at different points in a two-dimensional space and express relationships between such observations weighted by the spatial distance between them

For this purpose, they modelled the network topology as a proximity-matrix which contains, for each sensor, a row of distance values. These values represent the length of the water pipe connection between two sensors (with length=0 if two sensors are not connected).
