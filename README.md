# Spark-Streaming-Anomaly-Detection-in-Water-Distribution-Network

Abstract
The negative consequences of non-revenue water losses from Water Distribution Systems (WDS) can be reduced through the successful and prompt identification of bursts and abnormal conditions. Here we present a preliminary investigation into the application of a probabilistic demand forecasting approach to identify pipe bursts. The method produces a probabilistic forecast of future demand under normal conditions. This, in turn, quantifies the probability that a future observation is abnormal.
