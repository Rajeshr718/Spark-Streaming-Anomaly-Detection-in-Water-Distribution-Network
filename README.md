## Spark?

From the beginning, Spark was optimized to run in memory, helping process data far more quickly than alternative approaches like Hadoop’s MapReduce, which tends to write data to and from computer hard drives between each stage of processing. Its proponents claim that Spark running in memory can be100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce, but also 10 times faster when processing disk-based data in a similar way to Hadoop MapReduce itself. This comparison is not entirely fair, not least because raw speed tends to be more important to Spark’s typical use cases than it is to batch processing, at which MapReduce-like solutions still excel.
